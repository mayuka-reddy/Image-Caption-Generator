# Image Caption Generator using Flickr Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates an Image Caption Generator built using deep learning techniques with Keras and TensorFlow. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text generation, the model generates descriptive captions for images from the Flickr dataset.

## Features
- Utilizes CNNs (e.g., InceptionV3, ResNet) for effective image feature extraction.
- Implements LSTM networks to generate coherent captions.
- Trained on the Flickr dataset containing thousands of images with captions.
- Combines visual and textual features to enhance caption accuracy.
- Demonstrates transfer learning by using pre-trained models.

## Dataset
The Flickr dataset is used for training and evaluation. It includes:
- Images with corresponding descriptive captions.
- Variety of scenes, objects, and activities for robust learning.

## Architecture
1. **Image Feature Extraction:**
   - Pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3, ResNet) extracts feature vectors from images.
2. **Text Generation:**
   - LSTM processes the extracted features and generates captions word by word.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Install the requirements using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-caption-generator.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory:
```
cd image-caption-generator
```
3. Run the training script:
```
python train.py
```
4. Generate captions for new images:
```
python generate_caption.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results
Sample image captions generated by the model:
- Image 1: "A dog playing with a ball in the park."
- Image 2: "A group of people hiking up a mountain trail."

## Applications
- Automated image tagging for accessibility.
- Enhancing search capabilities in image repositories.
- Assisting visually impaired users through descriptive captions.

## Conclusion
This project illustrates how deep learning can bridge visual and textual domains, creating meaningful image descriptions. Future improvements could involve more sophisticated architectures or training on larger datasets for enhanced accuracy.
